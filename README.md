# SenseMe
Android App to transmit sensor data to CSV

SenseMe has been created as part of the Urban Computing assignment to relay sensor data from any of the available sensors and create a dataset out of it. 

The app uses SensorManager in Android to get access to the available sensors on a smartphone. In this app, the light sensor has been captured and the data 
is relayed to a CSV file that is stored on the smartphone's internal storage.
